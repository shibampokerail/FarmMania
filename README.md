- Map ITCH.IO Kijosoft
- Reddit (I could not find the link that I used for sprites but I know that I got it from reddit)
- Most of the music is from RJPASIN and Flawed Mangoes.
- I used chatgpt instead of looking at p5.js/docs. I did not use it extensively(not that it matters, but just putting it out there!).
